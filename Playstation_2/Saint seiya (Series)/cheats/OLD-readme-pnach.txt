Saint seiya series on ps2 only released in japan and europe with their respective problems (japan only japanese for non japanese) and europe (only in blurry PAL 50hz/25fps tv mode) so debugging executables couple moths ago i find the games has locked their video modes and languages, with this codes you can play European version in NTSC 60hz tv mode and framerate unlocked ( 60fps) but for people has the japanese version you can play in 4 languages, the languages files are hidden (or maybe unfinished) this codes unlock the languages and convert your japanese copy in multilanguage game with japanese intro and music, like always use my tutorials in my blog o check readme.

+All in NTSC 60hz Video mode
+All with 60 fps unlock
+optional codes for Hades changed the framebufer config for less blurry image in emulators (disable or not use it if you have problems on original hardware or consoles)

How to apply patches.

1 - dump your game into .ISO (google is your friend)

2 - Compare the sha1 hash for verify correct .ISO dump

3 - APPLY/PATCH DIRECTLY GAME DUMPS .ISO=DVD FOR PS2/PS3/PS4/PC
use PS2 Patch Engine PC tool by pelvicthrustman 1.03 (search psxplace.com for tool)

open ps2_patch_engine tool in pc (windows only)
look in table/sheet or open with notepad app the xxxx.pnach file for the game according your game version / region
load the xxxxx.iso or xxxxxx.bin game dump in ps2_patch_engine tool and select “PNACH” option
copy all or desired “patch=XXXXXX..etc” code lines and paste in ps2_patch_engine (white window) and press “PATCH”
if you do all correctly the app will generate a “ your-game-xxxxxx_pached.iso or .bin file, use this file for load in your console PS2 or build (PS3,PS4) !!! This will change your game dump CRC keep in mind if you use patched dumps and other cheats (crc name will not match in this scenario need to be changed)!!!
