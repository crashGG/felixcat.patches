# About this:
disclairmer, this are only test, speculation, reasonings etc about code hacking, nothing i said here, forums, etc can be taken seriusly or truth about so no guarantees.
this repostory main reasoning is for preserve bunch of files projects, files i did, long hours of study, time learning etc not to be lost in my drive and can be used, test or enhaced for people with "nostalgic" feelling when playing this titles in modern pc emulators or (modded) consoles.
