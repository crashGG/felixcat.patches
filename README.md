# About this:
This is my findings, ideas, codes, information, experiments, deduction in a empirical manner, nothing is granted to work perfect or is correct information about code reverse enginnering nothing i said here, forums, etc can be taken seriusly or as "truth" so no guarantees will work ok.
this repostory main reasoning is for preserve bunch of files projects i did or update, long hours of study, time learning for no to be lost in my drive and can be used, test or enhaced for people with "nostalgic" feelling when playing this titles in modern pc or (homebrew enabled) consoles.
